Special Thanks for "Code with Harry"

### Folder Structure

1. Create a folder named `songs` in the project directory.
2. Inside the `songs` folder, create subfolders for your music categories. For example, `ChillBeats`, `Pop`, etc.
3. Avoid spaces in folder names. Use `ChillBeats` instead of `Chill Beats`.
4. Use Port `5500` for your files to work

**Adding Song Information:**

```markdown
### Adding Song Information

1. Inside each subfolder, place an image for the category and name it `Img.jpeg`.
2. Create a file named `info.json` inside the subfolder.
3. The `info.json` file should contain the following information in JSON format:

```json
{
  "title": "Place your song Name",
  "description": "Write your description"
}
```

### Note: Still I have not done using server side, the website would not load using git hub pages
